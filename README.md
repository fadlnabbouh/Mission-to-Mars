# Mission-to-Mars

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository was to scrape key websites for recent information and images of mars and create an informative web application and website to retrieve and display that information. Information was automatically scraped using BeautifulSoup and Splinter. Recent news about Mars and a featured image were retrieved, as well as mars facts and pictures of their hemispheres. The information was stored in a Mongo Database. Next, a web application was generated using HTML and Flask. Finally, the HTML was styled using Bootstrap and CSS styling. Notably, Bootstrap and CSS were used to make the web app responsive to all devices, to style the colours of the background, text, and table, to stylize the scrape button, and to display the hemisphere images as thumbnails and reduce their size.
